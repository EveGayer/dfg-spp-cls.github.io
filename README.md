## Homepage for the DFG Priority Program "Computational Literary Studies"

### To do
- Support for content in two languages!
- Blogs and Projects:
  - currently, the projects md-pages are camoflaged blogposts with an only slighly adapted html template
  - the project pages are in the blogs folder to take advantage of the automatic functionalities for md blogposts
  - to run a real blog, project pages and blogposts need to be cleanly separated, which requires a separate "system" for the former
- Arrange the footer more nicely!
- Impressum???
- Do something nice with the sidebar... photos? Or the navigation moves to the sidebar
- The red in the layout should be adjusted to the tone used in the letters of the logo.
